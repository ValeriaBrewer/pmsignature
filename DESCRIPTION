Package: pmsignature
Title: Extracting characteristic mutation signatures from a set of mutation data.
Description: This package is an R implementation of PMSignature (Shiraishi et al. 2014+),
   which identifies characteristic mutation patterns concealed in large amounts of somatic mutation data.
   In this method, the generative process of each mutaiton follows a mixed membership model,
   where each cancer genome has multiple source of mutations (mutation signatures),
   and each mutation is associated to one of the mutation signatures.
   By EM algorithm, we jointly estimate the mutation signatures and the membership parameters.
